# What am I suffering from? (The Trap of Perfectionism)
Since starting my research in October 2025, I've been eager to produce tangible results, no matter how small. However, looking back, I feel like I've taken a long detour.

Initially, I took a passive stance, just waiting for my senior to assign me tasks. The first task was reading a paper on 3D reconstruction for endoscopic images. As I tried to understand and implement it, I felt overwhelmed by boredom and a severe lack of foundational knowledge—deep learning basics, traditional algorithms, camera calibration, etc.

My conclusion at the time was: "I need to study the basics first." I immediately started watching massive lecture series like CS231n and EECS 498-007. I mistakenly believed that a "true researcher" must master every underlying theory in the world before starting actual research.

But reality contradicted my belief. I saw fellow students publishing papers within just a year. If my "bottom-up" theory was correct, they should have spent at least two years solely studying CS fundamentals before even touching a research topic. Confused by this gap, I consulted my professor.

His advice was a wake-up call:

"To produce results, you don't need to understand a paper 100%. Understanding just 20% is enough to start. Implement the code right away. As you struggle with the implementation, you will find the defects and limitations of the paper—and that exactly becomes your research topic."

This hit me hard. The scattered pieces of my knowledge finally started to connect. I once heard that the fastest way to learn is not reading a textbook sequentially, but jumping straight into what triggers your curiosity and learning what you need along the way. This is the Top-Down method, whereas I had been stuck in the Bottom-Up method. I don't think bottom-up is entirely wrong, but to be an effective researcher, top-down must be the primary driver.


## What is research?
Research is fundamentally driven by curiosity. Ideally, it begins with imagination. Imagination is where the true value of the "bottom-up" approach emerges: it is the organic combination of existing knowledge, which is the very origin of creation. For instance, I might read papers on SLAM and LLMs simply because they look interesting or are necessary for my work. It is only natural, then, to imagine combining them, resulting in something like Semantic SLAM. It feels akin to observing the historical intersection of geometry and algebra, which gave birth to calculus. Research, in this sense, is the act of making that imagination real—connecting existing knowledge and then rummaging through the vast sea of information (top-down) to bring it to life.

But sometimes, research doesn't start with a grand spark of imagination. As my professor pointed out, it often starts in the trenches. It begins by cloning a repository, running the existing code in various environments, and watching it break. When you test an algorithm in a new setting, it frequently reveals defects or edge cases that the original authors didn't account for. Identifying these specific problems, analyzing why the code fails, and figuring out how to overcome those limitations—that is also the very essence of research. It is the process of finding the gap between a paper's claim and the harsh reality, and bridging that gap.
