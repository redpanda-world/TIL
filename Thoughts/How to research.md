# What am I suffering from? 
Now that I started research since October 2025, I have been wanting to show a result, even though it is not noticeable, and trivial. However, looking back, It occured that I have 
wasted my time. No. I just bypassed, but I think I'm on the right way. What I did at first is just waiting for my senior to have me to do something. 
My senior has me to read a paper on 3D reconstruction for endoscopic image. And that was the first paper I read.
As I implemented it, it was boring. And I felt, and has been feeling like I'm short on basis such as knowledge of deeplearnig, traditional algorithms, camera calibration, and so on.
So! My conclusion was that I had to study basis. So I looked up some nice lectures like CS231n, EECS 498-007. 
And I set in my ways. I thougt that every researchers occupied all the knowledge about their field. A true researchers have to know the all theory in the world, I thougt.
But as I looking around, my fellow students have already published some paper just within a year. According my belief, It was no way, doesn't make sense. For their papers and 
my thoughts to be compatible, They should have studied CS for more than at least two years, but they have been researching for less than a year. I was confused and meet my professor.
He said
> "To make some results, first thing we should do is reading paper and just understanding it around 20%, that's okay, and implement its code right away.
> As you implement codes, you can realize defects of the paper and that is the topic of paper."

And the scattered knowledge come to combine. I once heard that the fastest way to learn something is not learning from textbook sequentially, but just do something
you think trigger your curiosity. And just learn everything related to it. It is called top-down method, and bottom-up is what I've done. I don't think bottom-up is always bad,
But the main method should be top-down method to be a researcher.


## What is research?

# How to get through my problem?

## How can I balance top-down and bottom-up?

## Grounds

# Then what actions should I take?
