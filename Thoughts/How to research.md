# What am I suffering from? (The Trap of Perfectionism)
Since starting my research in October 2025, I've been eager to produce tangible results, no matter how small. However, looking back, I feel like I've taken a long detour.

Initially, I took a passive stance, just waiting for my senior to assign me tasks. The first task was reading a paper on 3D reconstruction for endoscopic images. As I tried to understand and implement it, I felt overwhelmed by boredom and a severe lack of foundational knowledge—deep learning basics, traditional algorithms, camera calibration, etc.

My conclusion at the time was: "I need to study the basics first." I immediately started watching massive lecture series like CS231n and EECS 498-007. I mistakenly believed that a "true researcher" must master every underlying theory in the world before starting actual research.

But reality contradicted my belief. I saw fellow students publishing papers within just a year. If my "bottom-up" theory was correct, they should have spent at least two years solely studying CS fundamentals before even touching a research topic. Confused by this gap, I consulted my professor.

His advice was a wake-up call:

>"To produce results, you don't need to understand a paper 100%. Understanding just 20% is enough to start. Implement the code right away. As you struggle with the implementation, you will find the defects and limitations of the paper—and that exactly becomes your research topic."

This hit me hard. The scattered pieces of my knowledge finally started to connect. I once heard that the fastest way to learn is not reading a textbook sequentially, but jumping straight into what triggers your curiosity and learning what you need along the way. This is the Top-Down method, whereas I had been stuck in the Bottom-Up method. I don't think bottom-up is entirely wrong, but to be an effective researcher, top-down must be the primary driver.


## What is research?
Research is fundamentally driven by curiosity. Ideally, it begins with imagination. Imagination is where the true value of the "bottom-up" approach emerges: it is the organic combination of existing knowledge, which is the very origin of creation. For instance, I might read papers on SLAM and LLMs simply because they look interesting or are necessary for my work. It is only natural, then, to imagine combining them, resulting in something like Semantic SLAM. It feels akin to observing the historical intersection of geometry and algebra, which gave birth to calculus. Research, in this sense, is the act of making that imagination real—connecting existing knowledge and then rummaging through the vast sea of information (top-down) to bring it to life.

But sometimes, research doesn't start with a grand spark of imagination. As my professor pointed out, it often starts in the trenches. It begins by cloning a repository, running the existing code in various environments, and watching it break. When you test an algorithm in a new setting, it frequently reveals defects or edge cases that the original authors didn't account for. Identifying these specific problems, analyzing why the code fails, and figuring out how to overcome those limitations—that is also the very essence of research. It is the process of finding the gap between a paper's claim and the harsh reality, and bridging that gap.

# How to get through my problem?
The fundamental reason causes troubles is my thought that is to research, then absorb everything. And try to study without purpose. The power of study with purpose is enormous. If ones study without intends to make robot, projects, then the connection of knowledge gets weak. Otherwise, it gets strong sticking to project and know how is the knowledge used. 

So the key to get through this problem is project, goal based learning called Top-down method.

## How can I balance top-down and bottom-up?
As I mentioned, I don't think that bottom-up is useless. Somethimes it'd rather dig into from scrach. Until high school, 80% of bottom up is ideal in my opinion. Because what they learn until high school is general such as calculus, basic physics, etc. And for high school student to choose their career path, being exposed to various subjects is important.

But people for me who want to research, this should be avoided. It is about efficiency. To research, for the reasone that it could be used one day, it's no way to study everything. Top-down method provides clear path to stduy. For example, if someone research on SLAM to map stark, barren desert, maybe optimization methods like BA, sensor like IMU and related things(DoF, Epipolar geometry etc), other papers covered similar enviornment even though they are not about SLAM. To do this, we don't have to study others that we've studied in deep learning, Algorithm, and Computer architecture classes!

It doesn't mean that we don't have to study from scratch. Somethimes, ideas popped out by this way shed light on enovation. This is my action plans.

> ### 1. Define my problems.
> This can be done by curiosity, or experiments, as I mentioned
> ### 2. Learn related things
> Gemini or GPT will teach you what to study. And study them as we've done with confined bottom-up method(bottom-up of confined the range to study)
> ### 3. Study basis from scratch regularly.
> This is pure bottom-up method. We don't have any purpose, but just study that catch your eyes. You can study machine learning, physics, topology, or any papers etc. And read a lot of book. You can study because it looks neccesary or interesting, no matter what. It could make the robust ground. Because ideas come from connection, It could burst latent connection one day.
