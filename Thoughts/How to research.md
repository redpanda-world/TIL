# What am I suffering from? (The Trap of Perfectionism)
Since starting my research in October 2025, I've been eager to produce tangible results, no matter how small. However, looking back, I feel like I've taken a long detour.

Initially, I took a passive stance, just waiting for my senior to assign me tasks. The first task was reading a paper on 3D reconstruction for endoscopic images. As I tried to understand and implement it, I felt overwhelmed by boredom and a severe lack of foundational knowledge—deep learning basics, traditional algorithms, camera calibration, etc.

My conclusion at the time was: "I need to study the basics first." I immediately started watching massive lecture series like CS231n and EECS 498-007. I mistakenly believed that a "true researcher" must master every underlying theory in the world before starting actual research.

But reality contradicted my belief. I saw fellow students publishing papers within just a year. If my "bottom-up" theory was correct, they should have spent at least two years solely studying CS fundamentals before even touching a research topic. Confused by this gap, I consulted my professor.

His advice was a wake-up call:

"To produce results, you don't need to understand a paper 100%. Understanding just 20% is enough to start. Implement the code right away. As you struggle with the implementation, you will find the defects and limitations of the paper—and that exactly becomes your research topic."

This hit me hard. The scattered pieces of my knowledge finally started to connect. I once heard that the fastest way to learn is not reading a textbook sequentially, but jumping straight into what triggers your curiosity and learning what you need along the way. This is the Top-Down method, whereas I had been stuck in the Bottom-Up method. I don't think bottom-up is entirely wrong, but to be an effective researcher, top-down must be the primary driver.


## What is research?

# How to get through my problem?

## How can I balance top-down and bottom-up?

## Grounds

# Then what actions should I take?
