# ORB-SLAM: a Versatile and Accurate Monocular SLAM System
## 1. Problem and Contribution

The prior SLAM algorithms are slow. 
ORB-SLAM makes it possible to implement SLAM in real-time, maintaining performance comparable to existing models



## 2. Idea
ORB-SLAM tried to get it faster. To achieve it, it used
- ORB features
- Covisibility graph


## 3. How can I use these ideas?
- When my model is not fast enough, then I think I can use other methods to extract features. Also I can use covisibility or something retaining only important information.

## 4. Others
